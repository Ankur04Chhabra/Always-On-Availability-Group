Scenario 1: Node1,Node2 and Node3 are in Windows Server Failover cluster.
Scenario 2: SQL Server Service(SQLCLUSTER) in active passive mode in Node1 and Node2.
Scenario 3: SQL Server Service(MSSQLSERVER) is installed on Node3 as a standalone server.

As the Primary replica is SQLCLUSTER where We can perform Read/Write operation 
and secondary replica is MSSQLSERVER where We can read the secondary database
and Automatic failover of Avaialbility Group role is not possible in this scenario as Primary replica is in SQL Server failover 
cluster Instance.

because primary replica will be avilable either node1 or node2 and it will not be go down and will remain 
primary even if we manual failover from failover manager or one of Node(Node1 or Node2) goes down.

We can do Manual failover of AG role.

If primary and secondary replica's availability mode is set as synchronous mode there would be a manual 
failover with no data loss when we do failover.

If primary or secondary replica's availability mode is set as asynchronous mode there would be a forced 
manual failover with possible data loss when we do failover and need to resume the data movement as well
after failover. 

Connect SQL Server With Listener

Server Name: listenername,portnumber

If the port is default 1433 then no need to provide.
